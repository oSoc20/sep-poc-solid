# Solid Wrapper

This package provides a wrapper around Solid to allow the creation of an application directory, create files and fetch the data from forms.
This wrapper was written so that other developers who are not especially familiar with Solid can still create an application and turtle files.

# Using NPM 
npm install https://github.com/oSoc20/solid-elections-wrapper

```

## Usage
